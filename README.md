## Hi, Anca here! 👋

🌱 I’m a biologist transitioning into web development — learning new skills and gradually working on projects. I’m passionate about writing clean code and creating simple, effective apps.

🚀 Right now, I’m focused on mastering TypeScript and React as part of my final project before earning my front-end developer diploma.

👩‍💻 I’m currently working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, and React.

☕️ A bit about me:
- Coffee enthusiast
- Problem solver with a critical thinking mindset
- Quick learner who pays attention to details
